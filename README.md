## Introduction

**A Painted World** is a complete overhaul of TES IV: Oblivion with a focus on stylized and timeless visuals, modernized combat, deeper rpg mechanics, and meaningful progression. It features expanded cities, additional quests, more unique and detailed landscapes, and new lands such as Elsweyr. It is heavily focused on immersion and progression, and additionally has many slice of life features such as crafting, animal taming, fishing, and home decorating.

### Disclaimer

Owing to the need to clean master files and certain errors with Wabbajack, A Painted World only supports **English Steam** versions of Oblivion GOTY Deluxe edition. **GOG and other Languages are not supported**.

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK**. Your windows version **must be 21H2 or newer** to run both Wabbajack and LoreRim.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is **STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST**. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and RAM are needed.

## Installation

Due to being a Wabbajack list installing A Painted World is painless and easy, taking a fraction of the time it would to create a modlist like this yourself. You will need to own a Steam copy of Oblivion GOTY Deluxe Edition before proceeding.

### Pre-Installation

The following steps are required to be completed before downloading A Painted World.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.5-windows-x64-installer)
3. Fully uninstall Oblivion by deleting the folder and the Oblivion folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
5. Reinstall Oblivion into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonist's [SteamLibrary tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide).
6. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
7. Navigate to Documents\My Games\Oblivion and open RendererInfo.txt in a text editor. On the last line you should see ```Shader Package         : 19``` If this does not say 19 for you, change it so that it does. Close and save the file, then right click it and select Properties. Make a checkmark on Read-only.
8. Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These **will** mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.

### Wabbajack Installation

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

:warning: **NOTE**: LoreRim will **always** require the latest version of Wabbajack **UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY STATED HERE**. :warning:
