Skill bonuses now give +5 to health/mag/fatigue instead of +10.
- reworked enemy health and player damage scaling to reduce impact of additional flat damage added to all attacks. this mechanic is included to reduce chances of enemies becoming too health spongey, but was a bit too powerful and overshadowed your base character stats. Overall should feel very similar but slightly harder to kill high level enemies at low level.
- turned off MOO level scaling, something I forgot to do when updating to v5. this means average enemy level should be lower.
- nerfed multiplier to the attacker gauntlets' armor rating added as physical damage to hand to hand from 4x to 2x

- reduced number of starting health potions from 10 to 5
- nerfed argonian regen while in rain/water from 3/s to 2/s
- applied secondary elemental damage effects (drain speed, dmg health, damage magicka) to equivalent staves and scrolls. frost will now damage fatigue instead of drain speed

Details on Birthsign Changes

Birthsigns which damage an attribute will damage the attribute permanently until it is restored through potion, spell, ingredient, or visiting a chapel shrine. This is done to create a soft cooldown without a hard once per day limit, and to create more opportunities for roleplay.

- Apprentice - Those under the sign of the Apprentice regenerate magicka quickly, but their spells sometimes sputter out of control (5%). They can use the Apprentice's Folly lesser power to enhance their spellpower (30%), at further risk of mishaps (15%) for 30 seconds.
- Atronach - Those under the sign of the Atronach have great wells of magicka (+150), but do not regenerate magicka on thier own. Instead, they siphon magicka with their melee attacks. They also gain the lesser power Atronachâ€™s Thirst, which grants 50% spell absorption but damages their own magicka reserves over 30 seconds (3/s).
- Lady - Those under the Sign of the Lady have improved willpower and restore fatigue (40 points) when they perform a well-timed block (within 0.5s). At will they may use the Ladyâ€™s Riposte, reflecting incoming weapons and spells (40% for 30s), but damaging their personality (2 points).
- Lord - Those under the sign of the Lord regenerate health (3%/2s) over time, but are vulnerable to fire (50%). They also gain the lesser power Lordâ€™s Vigor, restoring health (6/s for 15 seconds) but gaining weakness to magic and normal weapons (100%) for the duration.
- Lover - Those under the sign of the Lover have improved personality (+15), and attackers have a chance to be calmed by their beauty. They may also use the Loverâ€™s Kiss, a lesser power which fortifies endurance on self (25 points) and charms (15 points) for 30 seconds, but damages their fatigue (50 points).
- Mage - Those under the sign of the Mage have more magicka (+50) and mightier spells (10%). They can cast Mage's Brilliance to store their next spell to automatically cast on themselves when they enter combat and fortifying magicka (250 points), but at the cost of their willpower (2 points).
- Ritual - Those born under the Ritual are resilient to many ailments and masters of healing (+40% healing power). The Ritual's Prayer allows them to ward off evil curses and creatures, at the cost of their health (5/5s).
- Serpent - Those under the sign of the Serpent are more resistant to poison (50%) and inflict poison damage to foes who do not detect them. At will they may use the Serpent's Bite, paralyzing their target (3s) and absorbing all attributes (15 for 15s), but sacrificing endurance (2 points).
- Shadow - Those under the sign of the Shadow automatically channel their magicka (1/s) into a chameleon effect (35%) when sneaking. At will they may activate the Shadowâ€™s Shroud, gaining invisibility (60s), but at the cost of damaged speed (2 points).
- Steed - Those under the sign of the Steed have more speed (+15) and have faster mounts. At will they can gain an incredible burst of speed and knock enemies down by running into them, but damaging their agility (2 points).
- Thief - Those under the Thief have a chance (10% of Luck) to critically hit with attacks and damaging spells, and the lesser power Thiefâ€™s Larceny, greatly enhancing their acrobatics and security and granting them a chance to avoid attacks, but at the cost of damaged luck (2 points).
- Tower - Those under the sign of the Tower reflect a portion of damage taken (15%). At will they may gain Tower's Vigilance, forcing enemies to attack them while gaining resistance to normal weapons (50%), night-eye, and detect life (15s), but becoming unable to move (5s).
- Warrior - Those under the Warrior have more strength (+10), become resistant to harm (50%) during power attacks and do more damage (+10) with them. At will they can enter the Warrior's Rage, restoring Fatigue (4/s) and fortifying Attack Damage (+10) for 30 seconds, but become exhausted after it ends.
