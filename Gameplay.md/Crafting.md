## CRAFTING WIP

Many different items can be crafted using various crafting tools. Large crafting tools can be purchased from merchants and placed inside and near any buildings you or your faction owns. Examples of large crafting objects are forges, anvils and tanning racks. Small crafting objects can both be purchased and found as loot. They can be used from the player character's inventory. Examples of small crafting objects are sewing kits and tinker's tools.

Wells, fountains, kegs, large barrels, forges and anvils are automatically converted into usable objects. These objects can be used for crafting.

### Fishing
Head to The Flowing Bowl in Anvil and talk to Maenlorn. You can buy various fishing rods and the guide book "All About Fishing" from him, as well as ask him several things about fishing. Alternatively, the standard wooden fishing rod is available in the Imperial City (Jensine, Sergius from Three Brothers), Bravil (The Fair Deal), and Leyawiin (Best Goods and Guarantees)

Equip a fishing rod, and swing facing a body of water. There will be a small "splash", and your "bobber" will have landed. Once you see a big splash, quickly reel in by blocking (right-click) to get your catch.
