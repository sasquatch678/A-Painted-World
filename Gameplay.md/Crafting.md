## CRAFTING WIP

Many different items can be crafted using various crafting tools. Large crafting tools can be purchased from merchants and placed inside and near any buildings you or your faction owns. Examples of large crafting objects are forges, anvils and tanning racks. Small crafting objects can both be purchased and found as loot. They can be used from the player character's inventory. Examples of small crafting objects are sewing kits and tinker's tools.

Wells, fountains, kegs, large barrels, forges and anvils are automatically converted into usable objects. These objects can be used for crafting.

Craft manuals include recipes of all craftable items and tools. There are 6 crafting manuals, which cover blacksmithing, carpentry, cooking, inscription, tailoring and tinkering. Manuals can be crafted using inscription. Crafting tools can be purchased from many merchants. Large objects like forges, anvils and tanning racks can be purchased as deeds. Deeds can be used by hotkeying the deed and using it while being in gamemode. This can only be done inside or near a building you or your faction owns. As example, to place a forge, hotkey a forge deed. Using the hotkey will place a forge, which is considered a marker. Use the deed again to place the forge somewhere else, or target the forge to remove the forge. When activating the forge (press spacebar) the deed is removed and the forge is placed into the game-world. The forge can be picked up by grabbing it (press z key).

### Blacksmithing
Mined ore can be smelted into ingots using a blacksmith's hammer and a forge. To do this, add the ore to the forge and hit the forge with a hammer. The ingots can then be added to an anvil to craft equipment (or be used for tinkering). This is done in a similar way, by hitting the anvil with a blacksmith's hammer.

### Carpentry
Logs, collected through lumberjacking, can be converted into boards using a saw pit. To do this, add the logs to the saw pit and then activate (press spacebar) the pit saw. The pit saw is part of the saw pit. A workbench is used to craft items from these boards. The workbench is used similar to the saw pit. Add boards (and possibly other items, like cloth and ingots) and activate the tools lying on the workbench.

### Tailoring
Animal pelts can be converted into leather using a tanning rack. To do this, add the animal pelts to the tanning rack and then hit it with a skinning knife.
A spinning wheel is used to convert wool into yarn. A loom turns the yarn into cloth, which can then be used to craft clothing using a sewing kit.

### Tinkering
Tinker's tools can be used to create lockpicks, repair hammers, scissors and many other small items. Simply use/equip the tinker's tools to start crafting.

### Fletching
The fletching jig is used to craft arrows. To craft arrows you'll need shafts, arrow heads and feathers. Shafts are created using boards and a workbench. Arrow heads are made with ingots and tinker's tools. Feathers can be purchased from merchants and are found on birds, like chickens and archer npcs.

### Cooking
A Grain Grinder, Rolling Pin, Skillet and Pitcher are tools to cook food, like bread, fish and meat. A Wine Maker is used to make wine. Eating cooked food will give a temporary bonus to certain attributes (strength, intelligence, etc.), which is based on the type of food. Cooked food will remain cooked for several hours. Some food, like meat and fish can be cooked again after cooling down. Freshly made wine requires some time to turn into sweet, semi-sweet, dry or spoiled wine (poison). A Skillet is used to barbecue meat and fish. This requires being near a working fire to be successful. A Rolling Pin is used to bake bread, pies and cakes, which also requires being near a working fire. Some ingredients require flour, which can be made by grinding Wheat Grain in a Grain Grinder. A pitcher is used to store water or milk. Use an empty pitcher on a well (or other water source) to collect water, or a cow to collect milk. Full pitchers can be emptied by equipping them. Wine can be made using grapes and a Wine Maker. A Wine Maker can be purchased from any merchants selling food. They will also sell all other cooking tools. Cooking tools can be crafted using Tinker's Tools.

### Stone crafting
Use a pickaxe on any rocks to collect stones. Use these stones to craft large objects like houses and wells.

### Inscription
A Quill, inkwell and parchments can be used to craft books, like crafting manuals. Book selling merchants sell Book Writing Kits, which include everything necessary to write books.

### Fishing
Head to The Flowing Bowl in Anvil and talk to Maenlorn. You can buy various fishing rods and the guide book "All About Fishing" from him, as well as ask him several things about fishing. Alternatively, the standard wooden fishing rod is available in the Imperial City (Jensine, Sergius from Three Brothers), Bravil (The Fair Deal), and Leyawiin (Best Goods and Guarantees)

Equip a fishing rod, and swing facing a body of water. There will be a small "splash", and your "bobber" will have landed. Once you see a big splash, quickly reel in by blocking (right-click) to get your catch.
