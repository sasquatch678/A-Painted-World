## CRAFTING (WIP)

Many different and useful items can be crafted using various crafting tools. Crafting rewards experience based on the material cost of the item. Wells, kegs, tanning racks, cooking pots, and anvils are automatically converted into usable objects and can be found all over the world. There are also smelters and workbenches placed in each blacksmith shop, tanning racks in each Fighters guildhall, and sewing stations in each Mages guildhall. These stations can also all be purchased from miscellaneous vendors, or crafted into a placeable item ie. to put in player homes and are all used for crafting.

There are also some smaller crafting tools like the fletching jig, toolbox, shears, etc. Some of these are requirements to harvest a specific resource used at the larger stations ie. wool. Others are a way to craft certain smaller objects on the fly without having to visit a larger station.

Any rock in the world can be mined with a pickaxe. After a few swings a rock will drop on the ground. Rocks can be converted to stone at a workbench and are used in many crafting recipes.

Any tree in the world can be chopped with any axe. After a few swings a log will drop onto the ground. Logs can be converted to planks at a workbench and are used in many crafting recipes.

Any well can be interacted with while a pitcher is in the players inventory and the pitcher will be filled with water. Water can be boiled at a cooking pot and is used in several crafting recipes.

Any cow can be milked by pressing the interact key while a pitcher is in the player's inventory and the pitcher will be filled with milk. Milk can be pasteurized at a cooking pot and is used in several crafting recipes.

Any rock in a dungeon can be randomly converted into an ore vein. These ores can be turned into ingots at a smelter. Ingots are used primarily to craft armor and weapons at an anvil, but are also used in several other crafting recipes.

### Fishing
Head to The Flowing Bowl in Anvil and talk to Maenlorn. You can buy various fishing rods and the guide book "All About Fishing" from him, as well as ask him several things about fishing. Alternatively, the standard wooden fishing rod is available in the Imperial City (Jensine, Sergius from Three Brothers), Bravil (The Fair Deal), and Leyawiin (Best Goods and Guarantees)

Equip a fishing rod, and swing facing a body of water. There will be a small "splash", and your "bobber" will have landed. Once you see a big splash, quickly reel in by blocking (right-click) to get your catch.
