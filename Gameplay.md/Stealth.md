## STEALTH

### Armor Penalty
Any shield or heavy armor will add a sneak penalty equal to 1/3 the weight of the shield or each armor piece. Being unarmored gives a 10% bonus to sneak. Light armor has no penalty or bonus.

### Weapon Penalty
When you hold a weapon while sneaking a penalty to your sneak skill is applied depending on the weapon's general type and reach.

Bows & Staves: -6
Two Handed:  -12
One Handed: 11 * reach -5 (rounded up)

When the equipped weapon is a dagger the penalty is further reduced by your grade of mastery in the Sneak Skill
(Novice = 0 ... Master = 4)

### Melee Sneak Attacks:
Sneak-attack damage with melee weapons is now dependent on the weapon type and speed, and sneak skill has a greater effect on the damage.
