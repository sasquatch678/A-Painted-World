## LEVELING

You should forget any retained knowledge from Vanilla Oblivion on efficient leveling, it does not exist here.

Experience is no longer gained by increasing your skills, and skills are no longer raised by using them. You gain experience from doing almost any task in the world. Unlocking chests and disarming traps, killing enemies, doing quests, discovering locations, gaining fame/infamy, closing oblivion gates, etc. Sleeping will also give a rested experience buff. 

The player's level is capped at 50. When you gain enough experience to increase your level, the levelup icon will appear on the hud. You may open your character sheet, and click on the text that says click to levelup. In the levelup menu you will have 10 attribute points and 35 skill points. You can only put at most 5 points into a single attribute or skill per level. Additionally, to raise skills up to Journeyman the player must be at least level 5, up to Expert at least level 10, and up to Master at least level 20. Skills cost 5 skill points to raise by 1, however the cost is reduced by 1 if the skill is one of the skills in your class, and is reduced again by 1 if the skill is part of your class specialization. Skills will also cost 1 extra skill point per mastery level, ie. raising a skill at journeyman level will cost 2 points instead of 1.

If you choose, you can disable this experience based leveling system by disabling the mod Oblivion XP Update in the optional mods section of MO2, and instead enable the two optional mods Skill Diary Undone and Attribute Progression Redesign. This will make you level your skills by using them as in vanilla, however thanks to these two mods you won't have to worry about minmaxing at all.
