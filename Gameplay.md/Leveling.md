## LEVELING

You should forget any retained knowledge from Vanilla Oblivion on efficient leveling, it does not exist here.

Experience is no longer gained by increasing your skills, and skills are no longer raised by using them. You gain experience from doing almost any task in the world. Unlocking chests and disarming traps, killing enemies, doing quests, eating new ingredients, closing oblivion gates, etc. Thusly, training no longer increases your skills either but gives a flat amount of character xp instead. Sleeping will give up to an 8hr 25% bonus experience buff.

When you gain enough experience to increase your level, a message box will appear and you will be given a predetermined amount of attribute and skill points. In the character menu you can allocate these in any way that you wish. You will get a separate amount of skill points dedicated for your major skills and a lesser amount dedicated for using on minor skills.

There is an optional mod you can enable to change the system more similarly to vanilla where you level by raising your major/minor skills and skills are increased by using them. However you will still get a designated amount of attribute points to spend however you please each level, the min-maxing of vanilla will still not exist.
