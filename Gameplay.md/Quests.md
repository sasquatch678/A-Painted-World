# Quests 

Most quests will show up in the new Progress Tracker menu, which can be accessed in the stats or map menu. This will give you an overview of your current total progress in the game as well as a small blurb on each questline and how they may be started.

## Main Quest

The player begins the game on board a ship rather than starting in the Imperial Prison. You can choose from a variety of starting options which will affect what equipment you start with (choosing a wealthier background will give you better starting equipment and therefore make the start of the game easier; to start with no equipment or spells, choose the "beggar" option), and then choose a city in which to dock -- Anvil, Bravil, the Imperial City, or Leyawiin. You can also choose to start the game as a vampire.

To start the main quest, simply get arrested in the Imperial City and choose to go to jail (as long as "Scheduled for Execution" is not currently active). The Emperor and his entourage will find you in your cell and you will go through the usual tutorial dungeon; the enemies are now leveled and the special "tutorial" versions of items have been replaced with the real deal. Please note that the goblins will probably be rather difficult for a character who relies heavily on equipment – it may be preferable to simply pick the lock and follow the Blades and the Emperor as soon as you first part.

References to the player’s imprisonment and the Emperor’s death will be blocked until the main quest begins. The Dragonfires burn in the Temple of the One, the Emperor attends court every day in the Elder Council Chambers, Jauffre lives peacefully at Weynon Priory, and Slythe Seringi wanders around his farm, terrified of the Sunken One’s imminent wrath. Kvatch has no Oblivion gate before the Crisis starts.

## Faction Quests

One of the quirks of Oblivion is that it's possible to become the Arch-mage of Cyrodiil without ever casting a single spell. Or, less likely but still possible, to become head of the Fighters Guild with scarcely more than novice combat skills. You will now need to meet minimum standards in certain skills to advance in rank and continue each questline.

Each guild is also greatly expanded with many new optional handcrafted and radiant style quests. 

There is also an alternative faction the player may join for the Mages and Fighters Guild, either the Necromancers or the Blackwood Company, with a fully featured questline that mirrors the results of the original guilds.

### Fighters Guild

You will need to focus on training a few of your combat skills to high levels: Blade, Blunt, Block, Hand to Hand, Athletics, Heavy Armor,  and Armorer. Your skills will be certified automatically via quest update when you reach a new threshold. Consult the quest in your journal if you are uncertain what is required next.

Here are the ranks for the Fighters Guild, the total # of additional quests required to achieve that rank, and the skill certifications required.

|Guardian| 3 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 3 Expert
|Champion| 3 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 3 Expert, 1 Master

### Mages Guild

You will need to focus on training your magic skills to high levels. Your skills will be certified automatically via quest update when you reach a new threshold. Consult the quest in your journal if you are uncertain what is required next. Here are the ranks for the Mages Guild and the skill certifications required.

|Rank	|Skill Requirements

## Modded Quests

If you get stuck or are unsure how to start any of these quests, please consult the mod page or readme file inside the mod before asking for help.

### The Blackwood Company
You can join the Blackwood Company by talking first to Ja'Fazir, the Khajiit in the Blackwood Company Hall in Leyawiin, or Jeetum-Ze, the Argonian in the same place. You will also receive a journal update if you read the Black Horse Courier article about the Blackwood Company and are not already in the Fighters Guild; one of these can be found in the Leyawiin Mages Guild Hall. Membership is mutually exclusive with the Fighters Guild, so you cannot join the Fighters Guild if you are a member of the Blackwood Company, and vice versa. Features 18 main quests and up to 13 additional sidequests depending on your choices in the main quests.

### Join the Order of the Black Worm
Have you ever been playing through the Mages Guild questline and thought, "I wonder what it would be like to join the Order of the Black Worm and become a necromancer working for the King of Worms?" 
This mod lets you join the Necromancer faction, the Order of the Black Worm, part way through the Mages Guild questline. It has around a dozen new quests, which mostly mirror the Mages Guild quests but with you helping the necromancers instead. If you decide to stay loyal to the Mages Guild, the questline should be unaffected, as should the rest of the game. But if you do join the Order of the Black Worm, you leave the Mages Guild and all of its benefits, but the necromancers will provide you with equivalent benefits. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/54847


### Hackdirt The Deep Ones
Have you ever wondered who the DEEP ONES really were? What secrets or treasures to they hold in their caverns? Now you can, but beware of what you may find, a secret so terrible that it could shake Tamriel apart<br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/36224

### Thieves Guild HQ - Unhealthy Competition
This mod is both a player home and a full questline that continues the Thieves Guild story. After becoming the Gray Fox and assuming responsibility for the Thieves Guild, there is still more to be done. Complete contracts for clients and help your guild combat a new threat in Cyrodiil, while residing in a fully equipped hideout/player home. Steal valuable items, manage the Thieves Guild's operations, recruit new members to see an increase in profit, and solve the mystery that threatens the Thieves Guild and the rest of Cyrodiil.<br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/34465

### Companion Vilja
The young nord alchemist Vilja has her own mission in Cyrodiil - but she needs your help! Will you let her tag along? Will you let your Cyrodiil life be changed by a talkative, curious and unpredictable girl who might be a nuisance at times, but who also will offer a strong, indepth friendship, and later on also optional romance. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/28977

### Knights of the Nine Revelation
Umaril has been vanquished and the people of Cyrodiil hail you as the Divine Crusader. But little do they know that Pelinal's relics hold the key to protecting the freedom of all humankind... or enslaving it. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/42490

### The Ayleid Steps
Discover the ancient Ayleid teleporting network of Step stones, find out how to activate it, and then use the Steps to discover a new way of traveling around Cyrodiil, and search for new unknown Ayleid sites. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/16316

### Mudwater
This mod adds an Argonian village called Mudwater to the Blackwood Forest. The village is made almost completely from new meshes and comes with four quests. The quests are rather short, but they are hopefully fun - there is much more to see than just the village. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/35434

### Bounty Quests Fixed and Polished
In the lower-class inns in each city (except the Imperial City – see below), you'll find a bounty board with a notice on it. Activate it, and you'll receive a random bounty – either Kill, Exterminate, or Recovery. The inns are: The Flowing Bowl in Anvil; The Lonely Suitor Lodge in Bravil; Olav's Tap and Tack in Bruma; Newlands Lodge in Cheydinhal; The Grey Mare in Chorrol; Luther Broad's Boarding House in the IC Elven Gardens District; Five Claws Lodge in Leyawiin; Two Sisters Lodge in Skingrad.

Bounties are chosen randomly from a list of 20 for each city, but you'll only be able to get 15 before that city's quest is "complete" (this is to ensure a random set of quests each time you play this mod). New bounties appear on the board every Sundas, but you won't be able to take a new one if you still have an active bounty (this is per city; you can have one active bounty for each city at any given time).  If you don't want a particular bounty for whatever reason, talk to the innkeeper and you can decline it. It'll go back into the pool and may pop up again. You will not, however, be able to choose a new bounty in that city until the next week (see below) – this mod is intended to be played when you have nothing better to do or need a little quick cash, not blown through in a couple game days. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/48330

### Kvatch Rebuilt
Rebuild Kvatch, become the new count(ess) or find the rightful heir of the throne. Get your own statue in the city and fight in the arena to become the new champion! And just as you thought it was all done, uncover the dark secrets of old Kvatch! <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15412

### Thievery in the Imperial City
Not all merchants in the Imperial City are through and through honest. Derrien Venoit runs the Discount Merchandise in the market district; not only has he no qualms about buying stolen goods, the thieves in the Imperial City know that Derrien even gives tips about where to find worthwhile loot. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/52785

### The Well of Minlorada
Deep beneath the surface of Cyrodiil lies a long-lost Ayleid Ruin known as Minlorada. It is a legendary location, and it is said that a special Ayleid Well resides inside. This well is said to have been a gift to the Ayleids from Meridia, and it grants extended or eternal life to whoever draws from its power. Discover the lost ruins of Minlorada. Reveal the truth in the legends. Find the many secrets inside its walls! <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/38816

### Into The Void
On the shores of Niben Bay, the scenic Cadlew Chapel hides underneath itself a dark secret... Will you enter the hallowed halls and uncover the mysteries laid before you by an ancient evil? Into The Void offers a unique horror experience in Oblivion. Explore dark dungeons and traverse surreal hellscapes in this quest-driven mod which focuses on themes of madness, humanity, the passing of time, power and the corruption which often follows said power. To start the quest simply enter Cadlew Chapel and go from there.<br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/52365

### Elsweyr the Deserts of Anequina
High beyond the hills of the Niben lies the great desert plateau of central Elsweyr. From sandy desert wastes to rocky, red badlands, from grassy savannah to jungle coast, the lands of Anequina beckon. This new region, spanning the section of Elsweyr between Skingrad and Leyawiin, includes four new landscapes (desert to jungle), four new towns, several villages, a couple of dozen small quests, three small player homes and a monster-filled wilderness to explore. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/25023

### Frostcrag Reborn
A complete overhaul of Frostcrag, replete with added backstory, massive quests, and rewards galore. What secrets await within the wizard tower? <br />

### Vampire Hunting - Order of the Virtuous Blood
Cyrodiil is suffering from a plague of vampirism. With the Oblivion crisis, the attentions of the authorities have been focused elsewhere, and things are starting to get out of hand.  You may encounter vampires at night on isolated country roads, and even walking the streets of the cities. Vampire hunting is not without its risks. It really isn't safe to get infected with porphyric hemophilia over and over. You must have a pure heart and a steadfast resolve if you are to avoid turning into one of the things you are fighting so hard against. If the work does not destroy your body, it still might destroy your mind and your soul. But if nobody is willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices, things may become very bad for Cyrodiil indeed. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/30568

### Render Unto Them Their Desert - An Inn of Ill Omen Overhaul
The Inn of Iller Omen is an overhaul for everyone's favorite dingy little inn on the Green Road. This mod expands upon the Ill Omen in a number of ways. It also adds a highly detailed, open-ended story with a horror theme, taking place in an abandoned dungeon of the Imperial Empire. To start, find and interact with the skull hidden among the weeds in the ruins in front of the inn. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/54579

### Tales of Cyrodiil
Tales of Cyrodiil adds 14 quests for you to embark on. The quests are not of epic scales, but more of a... local scale. You will deal with commoners, nobles and the underworld with their little problems, like adventurers always do. These adventures are inspired by some of Daggerfall's side quests you can get from innkeepers and shopkeepers. Unlike Daggerfall, the Tales of Cyrodiil are unique and not randomly generated. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/48792

### Dark Brotherhood Continued
This mod allows you to continue taking contracts for the Dark Brotherhood after you have completed the dark brotherhood questline. Arquen now actually trusts you with more important jobs then running from Bravil to Cheydinhal! <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/25689

### Hoarfrost Castle
Sitting high on a bluff above the steepest part of the Orange Road is Hoarfrost Castle. The keep and castle yard rest at the foot of the Jerall Mountains proper - at the edge of the snowfall. The yard is almost always half-covered with snow, ice and frost. The windswept keep tower provides an unsurpassed view over the Great Forest, the Heartlands, and the Nibenay basin: from Bruma, to Chorrol - to the Imperial City itself.

Hoarfrost Castle is a cold place, but the roaring pit fire in the great hall always served to bar the chill from the keep itself. The keep and castle grounds played host to a chapel, graveyard, stables, master bedroom, dining chamber, kitchen, basement, smithy, servant's and guard's quarters, mage's study and workshop, display hall, and of course the warmest part of the keep: the great hall. A hive of activity and an outpost unto itself.

At least, this was the case until the castle's previous occupants were lost to some malevolent force that rose up within the keep. Rumour has it that only the Castle Steward survived to tell the horrific tale; and is now willing to give ownership of the castle up to whoever proves powerful enough to wrest control of the keep from whatever monstrosities now dwell inside. He keeps a solitary watch over Hoarfrost Castle's gate; waiting for some brave soul to come, and offer their help. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/14714

### Integration - The Stranded Light
Integration: The Stranded Light includes more than 80 quests with a strong emphasis on thinking, character interaction, choices, consequences, and lore. It delivers a seamless integration of Cyrodiil and Shivering Isles along with other lore races. A new, joinable guild plays an important role in many of the quests, which are unlike any in Vanilla Oblivion: A bit of thinking, often multiple solutions, quite heavy on social skills. It also reaches beyond the typical mold of quest mods, seeking to enrich the existing game world as whole.

The quests in Integration: The Stranded Light don't all follow a single storyline. It's more like a collection of somewhat intertwined short stories than an epic novel. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22320

### Shadowcrest Vineyard
Unlock the secret past of Shadowbanish Wine to obtain a large interactive vineyard and manor, located in rich fields surrounded by waterfalls and lakes. So come on over and have a drink...or are you scared of what lurks in the shadows? To start the quest visit the Chapel of Julianos, in Skingrad. On the first pew there is a note that you must read. The note is located on pew to the left if you are facing the altar. <br /> https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22810
