## Main Quest

The player begins the game on board a ship rather than starting in the Imperial Prison. You can choose from a variety of starting options which will affect what equipment you start with (choosing a wealthier background will give you better starting equipment and therefore make the start of the game easier; to start with no equipment or spells, choose the "beggar" option), and then choose a city in which to dock -- Anvil, Bravil, the Imperial City, or Leyawiin. You can also choose to start the game as a vampire.

To start the main quest, simply get arrested in the Imperial City and choose to go to jail (as long as "Scheduled for Execution" is not currently active). The Emperor and his entourage will find you in your cell and you will go through the usual tutorial dungeon; the enemies are now leveled and the special "tutorial" versions of items have been replaced with the real deal. Please note that the goblins will probably be rather difficult for a character who relies heavily on equipment – it may be preferable to simply pick the lock and follow the Blades and the Emperor as soon as you first part.

References to the player’s imprisonment and the Emperor’s death will be blocked until the main quest begins. The Dragonfires burn in the Temple of the One, the Emperor attends court every day in the Elder Council Chambers, Jauffre lives peacefully at Weynon Priory, and Slythe Seringi wanders around his farm, terrified of the Sunken One’s imminent wrath. Kvatch has no Oblivion gate before the Crisis starts.

## Faction Quests

One of the quirks of Oblivion is that it's possible to become the Arch-mage of Cyrodiil without ever casting a single spell. Or, less likely but still possible,
to become head of the Fighters Guild with scarcely more than novice combat skills. You will now need to complete about 3 times as many quests to finish the Mages Guild & Fighters Guild Quest lines, and meet minimum standards in certain skills.

### Dark Brotherhood

The main problems are with the beginning and ending. It only takes a single murder to gain the attention of this notorious organization. It's even possible you complete this requirement completely by accident, as some npcs you wouldn't suspect are counted as murder as part of other quests. I've upped the requirement to 3 murders before Lucien Lachance will notice you and come calling.

### Fighters Guild

In vanilla Oblivion, you need to complete 19 quests to rise to the top of the Fighters Guild. You will now need to complete a total of 55 quests. The extra quests
are from the Fighters Guild Quests mod, and are obtained from guildmembers in various guildhalls. Since Fighters Guild Quests adds almost 60 quests, you won't need
to complete all the available quests, but you will need to do a lot (36) of them. For the most part they can be done at any time. The quests are unleveled, so be
careful. Some of them may be too much for a low level character. If you can't complete a quest, try another guildhall and come back later.

You will also need to focus on training a few of your combat skills to high levels: Blade, Blunt, Block, Hand to Hand, Light Armor, Heavy Armor, Armorer and Marksman.
There are Guild Marshals in Chorrol who will monitor your progress. Talk to them to get your certification for each level of a given skill. No formal exams are
required. The Marshals will know if your skills are up to par.

Here are the ranks for the Fighters Guild, the total # of additional quests required to achieve that rank, and the skill certifications required.

| Rank   | Quests | Skill Requirements
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Associate| |
|Apprentice|	1	| 4 Apprentice
|Journeyman|	3	| 4 Apprentice, 1 Journeyman
|Swordsman	| 6	| 4 Apprentice, 2 Journeyman
|Protector	| 10	| 4 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman
|Defender|	15|	4 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 1 Expert
|Warder	|	21	| 4 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 2 Expert
|Guardian|	28	| 4 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 3 Expert
|Champion|	36	| 4 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 3 Expert, 1 Master

### Mages Guild

In vanilla Oblivion, you need to complete 18 quests to rise to the top of the Mages Guild. You will now need to complete a total of 54 quests. The extra quests
are from the Mages Guild Quests mod. For the most part the quests are repeatable missions, either gathering ingredients for the guild or rooting out necromancer lairs.
Raminus Polus will steer lower ranking mages towards ingredient gathering. As the quest line advances, he will point you to the necromancer quests. However, all quests
are available and can be done at any time. Be aware that some of the necromancer bosses may be too much for a low level character.

You will also need to focus on training your magic skills to high levels. Skills are certified by the local guildhall leaders, based on their specialization.

| Skill   | City | Leader
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Alchemy| 	Bruma	|	Jeanne Frasoric
|Alteration| 	Cheydinhal|	Falcar
|Conjuration |	Chorrol	|	Teekeeus
|Destruction |	Skingrad	|Adrienne Berene
|Illusion |	Bravil	|	Kud-Ei
|Mysticism |	Leyawiin|	Dagail
|Restoration |	Anvil	|	Carahil

Note that a few things may change during the quest line. You will get dialog to advise you how to proceed. In most cases recommendations can be done before or after
obtaining your apprentice skill certificate, but you will need both to advance to the Arcane University.

Here are the ranks for the Mages Guild, the total # of additional quests required to achieve that rank, and the skill certifications required.

|Rank	|    Quests	|Skill Requirements
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Associate||
|Apprentice|	|	7 Apprentice
|Journeyman|	3|	7 Apprentice, 1 Journeyman
|Evoker|		6	|7 Apprentice, 2 Journeyman
|Conjurer	|10	|7 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman
|Magician	|15|	7 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 1 Expert
|Warlock	|	21|	7 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 2 Expert
|Wizard	|	28|	7 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 3 Expert
|Master Wizard|	36|	7 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 3 Expert, 1 Master
|Arch-Mage| |
