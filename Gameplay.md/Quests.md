# Quests 

Most quests will show up in the new Progress Tracker menu, which can be accessed in the stats or map menu. This will give you an overview of your current total progress in the game as well as a small blurb on each questline and how they may be started.

## Main Quest

The player begins the game on board a ship rather than starting in the Imperial Prison. You can choose from a variety of starting options which will affect what equipment you start with (choosing a wealthier background will give you better starting equipment and therefore make the start of the game easier; to start with no equipment or spells, choose the "beggar" option), and then choose a city in which to dock -- Anvil, Bravil, the Imperial City, or Leyawiin. You can also choose to start the game as a vampire.

To start the main quest, simply get arrested in the Imperial City and choose to go to jail (as long as "Scheduled for Execution" is not currently active). The Emperor and his entourage will find you in your cell and you will go through the usual tutorial dungeon; the enemies are now leveled and the special "tutorial" versions of items have been replaced with the real deal. Please note that the goblins will probably be rather difficult for a character who relies heavily on equipment – it may be preferable to simply pick the lock and follow the Blades and the Emperor as soon as you first part.

References to the player’s imprisonment and the Emperor’s death will be blocked until the main quest begins. The Dragonfires burn in the Temple of the One, the Emperor attends court every day in the Elder Council Chambers, Jauffre lives peacefully at Weynon Priory, and Slythe Seringi wanders around his farm, terrified of the Sunken One’s imminent wrath. Kvatch has no Oblivion gate before the Crisis starts.

## Faction Quests

One of the quirks of Oblivion is that it's possible to become the Arch-mage of Cyrodiil without ever casting a single spell. Or, less likely but still possible, to become head of the Fighters Guild with scarcely more than novice combat skills. You will now need to meet minimum standards in certain skills to advance in rank and continue each questline.

Each guild is also greatly expanded with many new optional handcrafted and radiant style quests. 

There is also an alternative faction the player may join for the Mages and Fighters Guild, either the Necromancers or the Blackwood Company, with a fully featured questline that mirrors the results of the original guilds.

### Fighters Guild

You will need to focus on training a few of your combat skills to high levels: Blade, Blunt, Block, Hand to Hand, Athletics, Heavy Armor,  and Armorer. Your skills will be certified automatically via quest update when you reach a new threshold. Consult the quest in your journal if you are uncertain what is required next.

Here are the ranks for the Fighters Guild, the total # of additional quests required to achieve that rank, and the skill certifications required.

|Champion| 3 Apprentice, 3 Journeyman, 3 Expert, 1 Master

### Mages Guild

You will need to focus on training your magic skills to high levels. Your skills will be certified automatically via quest update when you reach a new threshold. Consult the quest in your journal if you are uncertain what is required next. Here are the ranks for the Mages Guild and the skill certifications required.

## Modded Quests

If you get stuck or are unsure how to start any of these quests, please consult the mod page or readme file inside the mod before asking for help.

### [The Blackwood Company](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/17448)
You can join the Blackwood Company by talking first to Ja'Fazir, the Khajiit in the Blackwood Company Hall in Leyawiin, or Jeetum-Ze, the Argonian in the same place. You will also receive a journal update if you read the Black Horse Courier article about the Blackwood Company and are not already in the Fighters Guild; one of these can be found in the Leyawiin Mages Guild Hall. Membership is mutually exclusive with the Fighters Guild, so you cannot join the Fighters Guild if you are a member of the Blackwood Company, and vice versa. Features 18 main quests and up to 13 additional sidequests depending on your choices in the main quests.

### [Join the Order of the Black Worm](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/54847)
Have you ever been playing through the Mages Guild questline and thought, "I wonder what it would be like to join the Order of the Black Worm and become a necromancer working for the King of Worms?" 
This mod lets you join the Necromancer faction, the Order of the Black Worm, part way through the Mages Guild questline. It has around a dozen new quests, which mostly mirror the Mages Guild quests but with you helping the necromancers instead. If you decide to stay loyal to the Mages Guild, the questline should be unaffected, as should the rest of the game. But if you do join the Order of the Black Worm, you leave the Mages Guild and all of its benefits, but the necromancers will provide you with equivalent benefits.


### [Hackdirt The Deep Ones](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/36224)
Have you ever wondered who the DEEP ONES really were? What secrets or treasures to they hold in their caverns? Now you can, but beware of what you may find, a secret so terrible that it could shake Tamriel apart.

### [Vampire Hunting - Order of the Virtuous Blood](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/30568)
Cyrodiil is suffering from a plague of vampirism. With the Oblivion crisis, the attentions of the authorities have been focused elsewhere, and things are starting to get out of hand.  You may encounter vampires at night on isolated country roads, and even walking the streets of the cities. Vampire hunting is not without its risks. It really isn't safe to get infected with porphyric hemophilia over and over. You must have a pure heart and a steadfast resolve if you are to avoid turning into one of the things you are fighting so hard against. If the work does not destroy your body, it still might destroy your mind and your soul. But if nobody is willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices, things may become very bad for Cyrodiil indeed.

### [Render Unto Them Their Desert - An Inn of Ill Omen Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/54579)
The Inn of Iller Omen is an overhaul for everyone's favorite dingy little inn on the Green Road. This mod expands upon the Ill Omen in a number of ways. It also adds a highly detailed, open-ended story with a horror theme, taking place in an abandoned dungeon of the Imperial Empire. To start, find and interact with the skull hidden among the weeds in the ruins in front of the inn.

### [Tales of Cyrodiil](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/48792)
Tales of Cyrodiil adds 14 quests for you to embark on. The quests are not of epic scales, but more of a... local scale. You will deal with commoners, nobles and the underworld with their little problems, like adventurers always do. These adventures are inspired by some of Daggerfall's side quests you can get from innkeepers and shopkeepers. Unlike Daggerfall, the Tales of Cyrodiil are unique and not randomly generated.

### [Order of the Dragon](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45258)
Have you already left Cyrodiil behind? Then you do not know what happened after the death of the Emperor's son, do you? The Oblivion gates are closed, the Amulet of Kings shattered, but the Empire is not saved. Rebels spread fear and terror in the counties of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, talk about the old sword prophecy is getting ever louder. Will the hero of Kvatch again prove worthy and be able to save the Empire from chaos?

### [Kragenirs Death Quest](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/26219)
Many years ago, Kragenir's tower had been sealed by the Knights of the Silver Nose, but as they die, the seals weaken... Can you find the keys required to break the seals so you can face Kragenir inside the tower before he escapes? Or... Are you going to help him? Aside from a main quest series KDQ offers tons of new miscellaneous quests in Cyrodiil's original cities, villages and locations. Many generic vanilla NPCs and dungeons will now be a lot more interesting.

### [Hoarfrost Castle](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/14714)
Sitting high on a bluff above the steepest part of the Orange Road is Hoarfrost Castle. The keep and castle yard rest at the foot of the Jerall Mountains proper - at the edge of the snowfall. The yard is almost always half-covered with snow, ice and frost. The windswept keep tower provides an unsurpassed view over the Great Forest, the Heartlands, and the Nibenay basin: from Bruma, to Chorrol - to the Imperial City itself. Hoarfrost Castle is a cold place, but the roaring pit fire in the great hall always served to bar the chill from the keep itself. The keep and castle grounds played host to a chapel, graveyard, stables, master bedroom, dining chamber, kitchen, basement, smithy, servant's and guard's quarters, mage's study and workshop, display hall, and of course the warmest part of the keep: the great hall. A hive of activity and an outpost unto itself.

At least, this was the case until the castle's previous occupants were lost to some malevolent force that rose up within the keep. Rumour has it that only the Castle Steward survived to tell the horrific tale; and is now willing to give ownership of the castle up to whoever proves powerful enough to wrest control of the keep from whatever monstrosities now dwell inside. He keeps a solitary watch over Hoarfrost Castle's gate; waiting for some brave soul to come, and offer their help.

### [Shroud Over Stalrous Manor](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/52408)
 A shroud looms over the Jerall Mountains and County Bruma. In a series of unusual circumstances you find yourself in the possession of the deed to Stalrous Manor. The manor does not have a welcoming appeal however and bears the scars of an eerie and cold history scorned by a series of disappearances. Unbeknownst to you, the estate holds a dark mystery that has yet to be unearthed. Explore the Stalrous Estate and the surrounding wilderness in search of clues that will uncover the mystery that has plagued County Bruma's past and threatens to plague its future. Confront sinister psychogenic horrors and delve into the darkest depths and dungeons of the Jerall Mountains in search of answers. Genuinely one of the scariest and high quality quest mods I have ever played.

### [Integration - The Stranded Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22320)
Integration: The Stranded Light includes more than 80 quests with a strong emphasis on thinking, character interaction, choices, consequences, and lore. It delivers a seamless integration of Cyrodiil and Shivering Isles along with other lore races. A new, joinable guild plays an important role in many of the quests, which are unlike any in Vanilla Oblivion: A bit of thinking, often multiple solutions, quite heavy on social skills. It also reaches beyond the typical mold of quest mods, seeking to enrich the existing game world as whole.

The quests in Integration: The Stranded Light don't all follow a single storyline. It's more like a collection of somewhat intertwined short stories than an epic novel.

### [Shadowcrest Vineyard](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22810)
Unlock the secret past of Shadowbanish Wine to obtain a large interactive vineyard and manor, located in rich fields surrounded by waterfalls and lakes. So come on over and have a drink...or are you scared of what lurks in the shadows? To start the quest visit the Chapel of Julianos, in Skingrad. On the first pew there is a note that you must read. The note is located on pew to the left if you are facing the altar.
