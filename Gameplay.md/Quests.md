### Faction Quests

One of the quirks of Oblivion is that it's possible to become the Arch-mage of Cyrodiil without ever casting a single spell. Or, less likely but still possible,
to become head of the Fighters Guild with scarcely more than novice combat skills. You will now need to complete about 3 times as many quests to finish the Mages Guild & Fighters Guild Quest lines, and meet minimum standards in certain skills.

 #### Fighters Guild

In vanilla Oblivion, you need to complete 19 quests to rise to the top of the Fighters Guild. You will now need to complete a total of 55 quests. The extra quests
are from the Fighters Guild Quests mod, and are obtained from guildmembers in various guildhalls. Since Fighters Guild Quests adds almost 60 quests, you won't need
to complete all the available quests, but you will need to do a lot (36) of them. For the most part they can be done at any time. The quests are unleveled, so be
careful. Some of them may be too much for a low level character. If you can't complete a quest, try another guildhall and come back later.

You will also need to focus on training a few of your combat skills to high levels: Blade, Blunt, Block, Hand to Hand, Light Armor, Heavy Armor, Armorer and Marksman.
There are Guild Marshals in Chorrol who will monitor your progress. Talk to them to get your certification for each level of a given skill. No formal exams are
required. The Marshals will know if your skills are up to par.

Here are the ranks for the Fighters Guild, the total # of additional quests required to achieve that rank, and the skill certifications required.
