## COMBAT

Fatigue is like your second health bar and affects your damage dealt, swing speed, and movement speed. At high fatigue you should look to go in and be aggressive while at low fatigue itâ€™s usually preferable to hang back and play more defensively. With no perks and starting attributes, fatigue regenerates at a rate of 10 per second. Running consumes 4 fatigue per second and sprinting consumes 16. 

Additionally, there are many new mechanics to take advantage of, listed below.

- Sprinting: Hold shift to sprint.

- Dodge: The player can tap left alt to duck, and tap it while moving to sidestep, at the cost of fagitue. The cost is increased based on the player's encumberance.

- Bashing: You can bash by holding block and using left click. Bashing deals 1 Poise damage and will interrupt and stagger Powerattacking/Blocking enemies. Bashing has a 1.5 second cooldown and requires 50 strength.

- Momentum: You gain a 33% damage multiplier when moving forward when hitting the target, or running left while performing a right to left attack, or running right while performing a left to right attack.

- Fatigue Drain: Two handed weapons drain fatigue when striking targets.

- Knockdown: If the player is hit from behind, there is a chance the player will be knocked down, based on the enemies blade or blunt skill. The chance is increased when the player is running.

- Predictable Offense (Light Attacks, Power Attacks, Bashing): If the player repeats the same attack too many times, the opponent will be able to predict the next similar attack and attempt to knockdown the player with a counterattack.

- Predictable Defense (Block, Dodge): If player repeats the same defensive move too many times, the opponent will be able to predict the next defensive move and the player's next defensive move may not be effective.

- Timed Block: If the player blocks an attack within X amount of time of holding the block key (1s for shield, 0.5s with weapon or unarmed), then they will take no damage from the attack and potential stagger will be reduced.

- Locational Damage: By aiming at the lower legs or feet of an opponent the player has a chance of knocking down the opponent. If the player's aim is off the NPC may counter with a bash and knock the player down. By aiming at the head of an opponent the player has a chance of stunning or knocking out the opponent.
