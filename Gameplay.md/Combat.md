## COMBAT

Fatigue is like your second health bar and affects your damage dealt, swing speed, and movement speed. At high fatigue you should look to go in and be aggressive while at low fatigue itâ€™s usually preferable to hang back and play more defensively. With no perks and starting attributes, fatigue regenerates at a rate of 14 per second. Running consumes 5 fatigue per second and sprinting consumes 18. 

In vanilla Oblivion, your weapon skill affects your damage 3x as much as your Strength, but in APW this is normalized so that weapon skill and Strength affect melee damage equally.

Additionally, there are many new mechanics to take advantage of, listed below.

- Sprinting: Hold shift to sprint.

- Dodge: The player can tap left alt to duck, and tap it while moving to sidestep, at the cost of fagitue. The cost is increased based on the player's encumberance.

- Bashing: You can bash by holding block and using left click. This consumes fatigue but drains fatigue from the opponent and can stagger or knock them back.

- Momentum: You gain a 33% damage multiplier when moving forward when hitting the target, or running left while performing a right to left attack, or running right while performing a left to right attack.

- Fatigue Drain: Two handed weapons drain fatigue when striking targets. The total fatigue drain is determined by the following formula: 5 + ((0.1 *attacker's weapon weight) *(attacker's strength) / (target's strength))

- Knockdown: If the player runs out of fatigue, they will be knocked down.

- Timed Block: If the player blocks an attack within X amount of time of holding the block key (1s for shield, 0.5s with weapon or unarmed), then they will take no damage from the attack and potential stagger will be greatly reduced.

- Locational Damage: By aiming at the lower legs or feet of an opponent the player has a chance of knocking down the opponent. If the player's aim is off the NPC may counter with a bash and knock the player down. By aiming at the head of an opponent the player has a chance of stunning or knocking out the opponent.

- Swing speed is determined by either Speed or Agility as a percentage from whichever is higher. This also applies to humanoid enemies, which opens up drain or absorb speed/agility as a way to counteract high swing speed from enemies.
