## COMBAT

Fatigue is like your second health bar and affects your damage dealt and swing speed. At high fatigue you should look to go in and be aggressive while at low fatigue it’s usually preferable to hang back and play more defensively. Your regeneration rate is determined by your equipped armor and perks with that armor. At low fatigue you won't be able to use light or power attacks at all until you regenerate back over a certain threshold. The minimum amount required scales with the weight of your equipped weapon. This minimum requirement is removed for light attacks at Journeyman Athletics.

Moving is overall more restricted, and wearing heavier armor causes you to move more slowly. You move more slowly when strafing or backpedaling. These penalties are reduced based on agility - At high agility, going backwards will barely slow you at all compared to at low agility. Furthermore, NPCs will now actually be slowed by their equipped encumbrance. This also means Burden is more useful - as it will slow enemies down when the magnitude isn't enough to halt them completely.

In vanilla Oblivion, your weapon skill affects your damage 3x as much as your Strength, but this is now normalized so that weapon skill and Strength affect melee damage equally.

Hand to Hand damage now scales with the armor rating of your equipped gauntlets, and does additional elemental damage when an elemental shield effect is active.

Blade, Blunt, Hand to Hand, Heavy Armor, and Light armor all have new and unique perks that will change how you play.

Additionally, there are many new mechanics to take advantage of, listed below.

- Sprinting: Hold shift to sprint.

- Dodge: At 50 acrobatics the player can dodge roll by holding block and pressing space bar. This dodge roll contains i-frames.

- Bashing: You can bash by holding block and using left click. This consumes fatigue but drains fatigue from the opponent and can stagger or knock them back.

- Knockdown: If the player runs out of fatigue, they will be knocked down. This is a vanilla mechanic, but I find it worth mentioning here.

- Timed Block: If the player blocks an attack within 0.3s of holding the block key, then they will take no damage from the attack and potential stagger will be greatly reduced.

- Swing speed is determined by weapon weight and either Speed or Agility as a percentage from whichever is higher. This also applies to enemies, which opens up drain or absorb speed/agility as a way to counter very fast enemies.

## Resistances and Weaknesses

Most enemies have some form of resistance or weakness to specific damage types ie. Undead are weak to silver weapons, spectral enemies are weak to shock damage. Fast and quickly attacking enemies can be countered by absorb speed or burden effects. This is to reward strategic thinking, there is almost always something else you can do to make combat encounters easier.

## Skill Specializations
At level 5 the player will get a choice to go down three different paths, depending on their class specialization. These are listed below. Every 5 levels after up to level 35, they will gain a new unique ability or passive related to that path, or upgrade an existing ability.
