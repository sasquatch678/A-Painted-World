## COMBAT WIP

Fatigue is like your second health bar and affects your damage dealt, swing speed, and movement speed. At high fatigue you should look to go in and be aggressive while at low fatigue itâ€™s usually preferable to hang back and play more defensively. With no perks and starting attributes, fatigue regenerates at a rate of 10 per second. Running consumes 4 fatigue per second and sprinting consumes 16. 

Additionally, there are many new mechanics to take advantage of, listed below.

- Sprinting: Hold shift to sprint.

- Dodge: At 50 Agility you can tap left alt to sidestep, and tap it again to roll.

- Bashing: You can bash by holding block and using left click. Bashing deals 1 Poise damage and will interrupt and stagger Powerattacking/Blocking enemies. Bashing has a 1.5 second cooldown and requires 50 strength.
