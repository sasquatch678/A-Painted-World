## COMBAT

Fatigue is like your second health bar and affects your damage dealt, swing speed, and movement speed. At high fatigue you should look to go in and be aggressive while at low fatigue itâ€™s usually preferable to hang back and play more defensively. With no perks and starting attributes, fatigue regenerates at a rate of 10 per second. Running consumes 4 fatigue per second and sprinting consumes 16. 

Additionally, there are many new mechanics to take advantage of, listed below.

- Sprinting: Hold shift to sprint.

- Dodge: At 50 Agility you can tap left alt to sidestep, and tap it again to roll.

- Backstab: enemies will take 20% more damage from behind

- Crititcal strikes: normal attacks have a chance to deal critical damage depending on your Luck. 20% crit chance at 100 Luck

- Parry: the player gets a 0.2 sec parry window when they start blocking. Attacks made against the player during this time will result in a parry. A successful parry will stagger the enemy, reset the player's Poise, and refund 20% of base fatique.

- Bashing: You can bash by holding block and using left click. Bashing deals 1 Poise damage and will interrupt and stagger Powerattacking/Blocking enemies. Bashing has a 1.5 second cooldown and requires 50 strength.

- Lock-On: you can lock on to enemies who are directly targeting you by pressing Q. Cancel it by holding right click and pressing Q again.

- Poise: Between 1-34 Agility actors will take two hits to stagger, between 35-59 Agility they will take 3 hits, etc. Power attacks count as 2 hits in this system. Two handed weapons deal twice as much poise damage.

### Archery

You can perform Charged Shots or Power Shots while a bow is equipped. You can toggle between the two by pressing H.

#### Power Shots

Power Shots can be performed by holding the attack key until your character briefly flashes, then releasing the attack key. A Power Shot deals 15% increased damage and can be performed in or out of combat. The timing of the flash is slightly randomized on each attack.

#### Charged Shots
Hold the attack key while a bow is equipped to charge your current shot. Charged shots will become more powerful the longer the attack key is held, however can only be performed while the player is in combat and are cancelled if the player is hit while charging.

Your maximum charge level depends on your Marksman skill. New ranks will become available at 25, 50, and 75 Marksman skill.

Charged Shots deal increased damage & poise damage depending on how long they have been charged. Ranks 3 and 4 will also cause the target to bleed for 3 seconds.
