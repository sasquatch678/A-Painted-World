## COMBAT

Fatigue is like your second health bar and affects your damage dealt, swing speed, and movement speed. At high fatigue you should look to go in and be aggressive while at low fatigue itâ€™s usually preferable to hang back and play more defensively. Your regeneration rate is determined by your equipped armor and perks with that armor.

In vanilla Oblivion, your weapon skill affects your damage 3x as much as your Strength, but in APW this is normalized so that weapon skill and Strength affect melee damage equally.

Additionally, there are many new mechanics to take advantage of, listed below.

- Sprinting: Hold shift to sprint.

- Dodge: At 50 acrobatics the player can dodge roll by holding block and pressing space bar.

- Bashing: You can bash by holding block and using left click. This consumes fatigue but drains fatigue from the opponent and can stagger or knock them back.

- Knockdown: If the player runs out of fatigue, they will be knocked down.

- Timed Block: If the player blocks an attack within 0.5s of holding the block key, then they will take no damage from the attack and potential stagger will be greatly reduced.

- Swing speed is determined by either Speed or Agility as a percentage from whichever is higher. This also applies to enemies, which opens up drain or absorb speed/agility as a way to counter high swing speed from enemies.

## Resistances and Weaknesses

Most enemies have some form of resistance or weakness to specific damage types ie. Undead are weak to silver weapons, spectral enemies are weak to shock damage. Fast and quickly attacking enemies can be countered by absorb speed or burden effects. This is to reward strategic thinking, there is almost always something else you can do to make combat encounters easier.
