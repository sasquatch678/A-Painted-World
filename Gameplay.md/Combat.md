## COMBAT

Fatigue is like your second health bar and affects your damage dealt, swing speed, and movement speed. At high fatigue you should look to go in and be aggressive while at low fatigue itâ€™s usually preferable to hang back and play more defensively. With no perks and starting attributes, fatigue regenerates at a rate of 10 per second. Running consumes 4 fatigue per second and sprinting consumes 16. 

Additionally, there are many new mechanics to take advantage of, listed below.

- Sprinting: Hold shift to sprint.

- Dodge: At 50 Agility you can tap left alt to sidestep, and tap it again to roll.

- Backstab: enemies will take 20% more damage from behind

- Crititcal strikes: normal attacks have a chance to deal critical damage depending on your Luck. 20% crit chance at 100 Luck

- Parry: the player gets a 0.2 sec parry window when they start blocking. Attacks made against the player during this time will result in a parry. A successful parry will stagger the enemy, reset the player's Poise, and refund 20% of base fatique.

- Power Attacks: Power attacks break blocks and deal extra damage. They can be performed by holding the left mouse button. Additional effects are added to power attacks depending on an actor's skill with their equipped weapon.

- Poise: Between 1-34 Agility actors will take two hits to stagger, between 35-59 Agility they will take 3 hits, etc. Power attacks count as 2 hits in this system. Two handed weapons deal twice as much poise damage.
