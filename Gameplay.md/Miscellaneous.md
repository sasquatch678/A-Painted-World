## MISC CHANGES
For new mechanics which don't fit cleanly into another section.

### TRAVEL
Fast traveling costs gold, to simulate the amount you would spend resting at inns and cost of resources. It is generally more expensive than using the alternative methods mentioned below as it is far more convenient. Fast traveling while on a horse will cut the time and cost in half.

As an alternative to fast travel, there are npcs in the basement of each Mages Guild who will teleport you to the guild of each major city. There are also npcs at each stable who will take you to other stables by carriage, and npcs at each dock location who will transport you by boat. 

### Lock Bashing
Locks can be bashed by attacking them with your weapon or fists. Your weapon or gloves/you will be damaged. Blunt and heavy weapons are best suited to the task. Player strength, weapon skill, and current fatigue are all accounted for in the formula. Power attacks give a 3x  bonus, but deal more damage back to the weapon/gloves/you. Bashing locks is a crime and can't be attempted while sneaking.

### Enchantment Charging & Soulgems
Enchanted weapons will automatically be recharged by 10% of your mysticism skill every ingame hour. 

Your Mysticism skill will now increase the amount of weapon charge restored by soulgems, up to +50% at a Mysticism skill of 100.

Soulgems can be filled by multiple souls, ie. trapping enough petty souls in a single Grand soulgem will behave as if you had trapped one Grand soul. The percentage filled is displayed in the inventory when placing the cursor over the soulgem.

### Nine Divines
Each Divine Altar restores one attribute up to 100 points. The attribute restored is the same as their blessing. Altars of the Nine will restore all attributes. Blessings of the Divine have also been reworked, their bonuses are as follows:
| Divine    | Blessing | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Akatosh | Fortify Speed 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Arkay | Fortify Health 15 points for 6480 seconds, cures all disease.
| Dibella | Fortify Personality 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Julianos | Fortify Intelligence 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Kynareth | Fortify Agility 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Mara | Fortify Willpower 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Stendarr | Fortify Endurance 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Talos | Fortify Strength 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Zenithar | Fortify Luck 5 points for 6480 seconds.

Wayshrine Blessings are twice as potent. Additionally, once per day you can enhance a bandage at an Altar of the Nine, improving the effects.
