## MISC CHANGES
For new mechanics which don't fit cleanly into another section.

### Travel
Fast traveling costs gold, to simulate the amount you would spend resting at inns and cost of resources. It is generally more expensive than using the alternative methods mentioned below as it is far more convenient. Fast traveling while on a horse will cut the time and cost in half.

As an alternative to fast travel, there are npcs in the basement of each Mages Guild who will teleport you to the guild of each major city. There are also npcs at each stable who will take you to other stables by carriage, and npcs at each dock location who will transport you by boat. 

### Lock Bashing
Locks can be bashed by attacking them with your weapon or fists. Your weapon or gloves/you will be damaged. Blunt and heavy weapons are best suited to the task. Player strength, weapon skill, and current fatigue are all accounted for in the formula. Power attacks give a 3x  bonus, but deal more damage back to the weapon/gloves/you. Bashing locks is a crime and can't be attempted while sneaking.

### Needs
The list has simple and balanced bonuses for eating, drinking, and sleeping regularly. Encourages roleplaying, without burdening you with negative effects if you don't. 

Eating or drinking any item considered to be food by the game contributes to your 'food pool', based on the weight and value of the item. Once your food pool reaches a threshold, you will be considered Well Fed. Whist 'Well Fed', you will gain slow Health regeneration outside of combat, which makes eating a meal before setting off on a dungeon crawl very beneficial. Your food pool depletes over time and when it reaches zero, you will no longer be Well Fed. 

Sleeping in a bed provides a 'Well Rested' bonus that increases Fatigue by 50 points for a long period of time. Sleeping in a safe indoors location provides the bonus for 12 hours, and any other location provides it for 6 hours. You will also gain rested experience based on the amount of time slept.

### Nine Divines
Each Divine Altar restores one attribute up to 100 points. The attribute restored is the same as their blessing. Altars of the Nine will restore all attributes. Blessings of the Divine have also been reworked, their bonuses are as follows:
| Divine    | Blessing | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Akatosh | Fortify Speed 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Arkay | Fortify Health 15 points for 6480 seconds, cures all disease.
| Dibella | Fortify Personality 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Julianos | Fortify Intelligence 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Kynareth | Fortify Agility 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Mara | Fortify Willpower 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Stendarr | Fortify Endurance 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Talos | Fortify Strength 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Zenithar | Fortify Luck 5 points for 6480 seconds.

Wayshrine Blessings are twice as potent. Additionally, once per day you can enhance a bandage at an Altar of the Nine, improving the effects.

### Runestones

Runestones no longer give a piece of bound armor and a bound weapon, but instead each gives a powerful, unique and permanent effect related to one of the three major specializations (combat, magic, stealth).

#### Reman 
Your power attacks that strike somebody who's blocking damages their shield's health by an amount equal to 3 times your skill in the weapon you're using. If they're blocking with a weapon, rather than a shield, the damage to the equipment is quartered.
#### Hestra
The boon grants you a passive 35% elemental shield to either Fire, Frost, or Shock. The elemental shield changes whenever you cast a spell featuring Fire, Frost, or Shock damage, to reflect the element used (cast a fire damage spell and it changes to fire shield, for example). If the spell features multiple damage types then it chooses what element based on priority (earliest in the list governs the resistance): Fire > Frost > Shock.
#### Sidri-Ashak
After spending an uninterrupted span of 10 seconds in darkness, you gain 25 points of Chameleon. This effect lasts until you've spent 6 uninterrupted seconds outside of darkness.

### Drugs & Alcohol
Alcohol offers a variety of benefits, but also makes your character drunk which blurs your vision and can knock you down. Wine tends to buff magicka and personality while hard liquor and beers tend to buff fatigue and physical traits.

Your character can now become addicted to Skooma. Most effects have been removed from the actual potion and added via script. The only effects you will see on the potion bottle are positive. In theory, it seems perfectly harmless on the outside, until you find out about the addiction and other effects. As you become addicted, there should be an "Addicts Diary" added to your Inventory. This will give you key insights into what level you are at, and how long you have until you absolutely must consume before going into withdrawal (at a daily rate as opposed to down to the hour). You will gain an increasing fortify speed effect while at the same time increasingly draining your willpower. Each addiction level has a requirement for skooma to be consumed, thus addiction can get quite expensive and without feeding that addiction the player goes into withdrawal however it can be refined using the newly added Skooma Apparatus, Moon Sugar, and Nightshade. The Apparatus can be purchased from Shady Sam, or picked up from a sack near the Prison Sewer Exit. If you become addicted and do not continue to drink Skooma, you will begin to suffer withdrawals. There are 5 levels of withdrawal symptoms, with each progressively draining more of your attributes. The higher level your addiction is, the higher level of withdrawals you will suffer. The only real cure of Skooma Addiction is to go through the levels of withdrawal and cure yourself. It's a choice that has to be made...although judicious use of WAIT and SLEEP can reduce the impact if you really want to disrupt the immersion.
