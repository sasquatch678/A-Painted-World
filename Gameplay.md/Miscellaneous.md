## MISC CHANGES
For new mechanics which don't fit cleanly into another section.

### Travel
Fast traveling costs gold, to simulate the amount you would spend resting at inns and cost of resources. It is generally more expensive than using the alternative methods mentioned below as it is far more convenient. Fast traveling while on a horse will cut the time and cost in half.

As an alternative to fast travel, there are npcs in the basement of each Mages Guild who will teleport you to the guild of each major city. There are also npcs at each stable who will take you to other stables by carriage, and npcs at each dock location who will transport you by boat. 

### Lock Bashing
Locks can be bashed by attacking them with your weapon or fists. Your weapon or gloves/you will be damaged. Blunt and heavy weapons are best suited to the task. Player strength, weapon skill, and current fatigue are all accounted for in the formula. Power attacks give a 3x  bonus, but deal more damage back to the weapon/gloves/you. Bashing locks is a crime and can't be attempted while sneaking.

### Needs
The list has simple and balanced bonuses for eating, drinking, and sleeping regularly. Encourages roleplaying, without burdening you with negative effects if you don't. 

Eating or drinking any item considered to be food by the game contributes to your 'food pool', based on the weight and value of the item. Once your food pool reaches a threshold, you will be considered Well Fed. Whist 'Well Fed', you will gain slow Health regeneration outside of combat, which makes eating a meal before setting off on a dungeon crawl very beneficial. Your food pool depletes over time and when it reaches zero, you will no longer be Well Fed. 

Sleeping in a bed provides a 'Well Rested' bonus that increases Fatigue by 50 points for a long period of time. Sleeping in a safe indoors location provides the bonus for 12 hours, and any other location provides it for 6 hours. You will also gain rested experience based on the amount of time slept.

### Nine Divines
Each Divine Altar restores one attribute up to 100 points. The attribute restored is the same as their blessing. Altars of the Nine will restore all attributes. Blessings of the Divine have also been reworked, their bonuses are as follows:
| Divine    | Blessing | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Akatosh | Fortify Speed 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Arkay | Fortify Health 15 points for 6480 seconds, cures all disease.
| Dibella | Fortify Personality 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Julianos | Fortify Intelligence 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Kynareth | Fortify Agility 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Mara | Fortify Willpower 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Stendarr | Fortify Endurance 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Talos | Fortify Strength 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Zenithar | Fortify Luck 5 points for 6480 seconds.

Wayshrine Blessings are twice as potent. Additionally, once per day you can enhance a bandage at an Altar of the Nine, improving the effects.
