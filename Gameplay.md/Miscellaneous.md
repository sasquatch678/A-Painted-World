## Miscellaneous Changes
For new mechanics which don't fit cleanly into another section.

### Lock Bashing
Locks can be bashed by attacking them with your weapon or fists. Your weapon or gloves/you will be damaged. Blunt and heavy weapons are best suited to the task. Player strength, weapon skill, and current fatigue are all accounted for in the formula. Power attacks give a 3x  bonus, but deal more damage back to the weapon/gloves/you. Bashing locks is a crime and can't be attempted while sneaking.

### Enchantment Charging & Soulgems
Enchanted weapons will automatically be recharged by 10% of your mysticism skill every ingame hour. 

Your Mysticism skill will now increase the amount of weapon charge restored by soulgems, up to +50% at a Mysticism skill of 100.

Soulgems can be filled by multiple souls, ie. trapping enough petty souls in a single Grand soulgem will behave as if you had trapped one Grand soul. The percentage filled is displayed in the inventory when placing the cursor over the soulgem.

### Nine Divines
Each Divine Altar restores one attribute up to 100 points. The attribute restored is the same as their blessing. Altars of the Nine will restore all attributes. Blessings of the Divine have also been reworked, their bonuses are as follows:
| Divine | | Blessing |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Akatosh | Fortify Speed 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Arkay | Fortify Health 15 points for 6480 seconds, cures all disease.
| Dibella | Fortify Personality 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Julianos | Fortify Intelligence 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Kynareth | Fortify Agility 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Mara | Fortify Willpower 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Stendarr | Fortify Endurance 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Talos | Fortify Strength 5 points for 6480 seconds.
| Zenithar | Fortify Luck 5 points for 6480 seconds.

Wayshrine Blessings are twice as potent. Additionally, once per day you can enhance a bandage at an Altar of the Nine, improving the effects. 

### Fishing
Head to The Flowing Bowl in Anvil and talk to Maenlorn. You can buy various fishing rods and the guide book "All About Fishing" from him, as well as ask him several things about fishing. Alternatively, the standard wooden fishing rod is available in the Imperial City (Jensine, Sergius from Three Brothers), Bravil (The Fair Deal), and Leyawiin (Best Goods and Guarantees)

Equip a fishing rod, and swing facing a body of water. There will be a small "splash", and your "bobber" will have landed. Once you see a big splash, quickly reel in by blocking (right-click) to get your catch.
