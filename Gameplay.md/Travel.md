### TRAVEL

Fast traveling costs gold, to simulate the amount you would spend resting at inns and cost of resources. It is generally more expensive than using the alternative methods mentioned below as it is far more convenient. Fast traveling while on a horse will cut the time and cost in half.

As an alternative to fast travel, there are npcs in the basement of each Mages Guild who will teleport you to the guild of each major city. There are also npcs at each stable who will take you to other stables by carriage, and npcs at each dock location who will transport you by boat.
