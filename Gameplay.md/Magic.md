## MAGIC

Magic has been greatly expanded, with over 30 new magic effects and spell types thanks to Av Latta Magicka and Supreme Magicka. Your starting magicka pool is determined by your total intelligence and your class specialization and major skills. Certain races start with higher or lower intelligence and certain birthsigns further increase the pool. Interacting with Ayleid Wells will each give a permanent and stacking +5 bonus to your magicka, until you interact with 35 total at which point you will gain a permanent +200 magicka and a +1/s magicka regeneration buff.

In additon to increasing your total magicka pool, Intelligence now also scales the magnitude of your spells by a percentage. Willpower increases (or decreases, if below 25) resistance to magic by a percentage. There is also a 10% multiplier added to your spells when wielding a staff, and subtracted when wielding a weapon or shield. There is no penalty or bonus when empty handed. These effects apply to npcs as well as the player.

Leveling magic skills now scales with magicka cost of the spell, so it is no longer the most efficient thing to do to craft a low cost spell and spam it a million times to level up.

### Magic Sneak Attacks
Touch spells start with a 1x sneak multiplier at novice sneak and increase up to 3x at a master level of sneak. (0.5x increase per level of sneak mastery).
Target spells start with a 1x sneak multiplier at novice sneak and increase up to 2x at a master level of sneak. (0.25x increase per level of sneak mastery).

### Spell Favoriting 
You can favorite spells by pressing F on them in the magic menu. Outside of the menu, pressing F will open the favorites menu which you can scroll through with the mouse wheel. 

### Magic Effect Combinations
These occur when the same target is hit by 2 interacting effects. The first time that happens, you'll see a tutorial message.

#### Convulsions:
Paralyze + Shock Damage

#### Deep Freeze:
Burden + Frost Damage

#### Ignition:
Poison + Fire Damage

#### Meltdown:
Elemental Weapons + Disintegrate Weapon

### Environmental Effects
Weather and location will affect elemental Destruction spells. All modifiers are multiplicative.
| Weather    | Effect | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Rain | Fire spells are 25% weaker; Frost spells are 15% stronger; Shock spells are 25% stronger
| Snow | Fire spells are 25% weaker; Frost spells are 25% stronger;
| Swimming | Fire spells are 75% weaker; Frost spells are 25% stronger; Shock spells are 35% stronger
| Inside Oblivion | Fire spells are 25% stronger

### Spellcrafting

There are many new spellcrafting and enchanting altars all over Cyrodiil, it is no longer locked behind access to the Arcane University. First, each Mages Guild hall now has an enchanting altar. Second, magic shops like Mystic Emporium, Rindir's Staffs, and Warlock's Luck now have them added.  Third, a few private dwellings of mage characters have them added (Henantier, Fathis Aren, etc.)  Last, many have been added to necromancer and sorcerer dungeons.

A new rare item called Welkynd Essence is handplaced in a few Ayleid ruins - using it allows creation of one custom spell for free.

### Enchanting

You can now place multiple enchantments on equipment, scaling with every 150 magicka.

- Staff enchanting: while you could enchant staves in vanilla, the result was a staff that only fired on touch range. Now any staff you enchant yourself fires at target. Rindirs Staffs now sell unenchanted staffs so you can enchant staffs with your own effects. Enchanted staffs may say touch or onstrike in the enchanting menu in some circumstances, but will be corrected once it has been enchanted.

- Recharging enchantments - all weapons will now regain charge equal to your mysticism skill every ingame hour.

- Soul Trap: Soul trap is a bit tedious to use. So to help reduce the tedium every time you cast soul trap on an enemy it will recharge the current weapon by 1%. When the enemy dies under the effect whether you have a soul gem or not it will recharge your current weapon by 5%. Soul trap when first cast on an enemy will feedback the level of the soul under your crosshair.

### Necromancy and Lichdom

- Reanimation has been given a big expansion. Instead of being used on only one unique staff, this effect is now available in form of multiple spells, spread throughout the world and can also be used in spellmaking.

- Necromancy and Lichdom introduces a new necromancy system where you create leveled undead followers using body parts, as well as the ability to transform into a Lich, complete with the accompanying animations. A Skeleton and Wraith form are also options. It begins when you pick up the Tome of Unlife during the quest "Where the Spirits have Lease" By reading different chapters of the book, you will gain the ability to harvest bodies for parts which you can use to create various undead followers. When you have the required parts you will be able to create the body, and then use magic to animate them to act as permanent followers. The spells are locked behind skill prerequisites, so I would recommend leveling your Restoration, Conjuration, and Mysticism if you want to be able to use them. All followers levels will be scaled to the player at the time of creation (e.g. If you create a skeleton at level 1 it will be a normal skeleton, but if you create a skeleton at level 20 it will be a skeleton champion.) In order to toggle whether a minion follows you or not just interact with them.

### Various Changes to Magic Mechanics

- New Concentration Spells will continue their effects as long as Cast key is held or until Magicka runs out.

- Different spells with the same beneficial effect will no longer stack with each other, instead the total effect power will be no more than the strongest of the spells. Feather is the only exception to this.

- Telekinesis spells have been overhauled into really useful utility spells. They can loot chests, open doors, loot dead bodies and pick up items. Additionally if you use without a target you can move yourself forward in the direction you are looking. Longer range spells move faster and further. If you cast on an npc or creature you will quickly move yourself behind their back which is great for pickpocketing or sneak attacks.

- Detect life is a very useful tool in detecting enemies and provides a bit more information on the dangers around you. The undead are not actually alive so the effect will be weaker and harder to see on them. During the effect if you place your crosshair over any friendly character it will indicate how strong they are.

  | Color   | Effect | 
  |:--------------:|:-------------:|
  | Orange | an enemy character that is stronger than you
  | Purple | an enemy character that is similar in strength to you
  | Blue | an enemy character that is weaker than you
  | Green | the character appears to be friendly

- Dispel - To allow mysticism to be used more offensively, dispel will damage summons you hit if you cannot hit the caster or your dispel effect is not strong enough.

- Mystic Hands - This is a spell that allows hand to hand attacks to cast your touch and target spells for a duration if you have the magicka instead of being a separate action. As you cannot enchant your hands this is the closest to providing a similar effect.

- Levitation comes to Oblivion! A group of mages from Morrowind brought it with them to Cyrodiil and have taught their secret to a few select members of the mages guild. This alteration spell allows you to take the battle to the skies and fire at enemies down below. This is a master level spell and not available for spell making due to its rarity (and potentially game breaking) If you don't move at all you will gently float up and down. Look up/down while moving to rise upwards and down faster. Enemies will freak out when you are levitating and cannot reach you making it difficult to snipe enemies off. Levitation can only be bought from the most skilled magic vendor or found by magic spell tomes in loot.

- Extrication - Teleport spells used to be big in morrowind but became less useful with fast travel. Now the new Extrication spell allows you to teleport to your last known safe outdoor location. This allows you to quickly return to the entrance of dungeons or to escape from a combat encounter outdoors or indoors. The spell takes a number of seconds to cast and will leave you vulnerable during the effect. Some locations this will be unable to be used like jail, the arena or magical quest areas.

- Burden spells in addition to adding additional weight now do what they are supposed to by having a chance to crush enemies and you to the ground for a short amount of time. The initial cast has a higher chance than subsequent casts of the spell.

- Feather spells now also protect against fall damage and can make you jump slightly higher.

- Water breathing spells now also cause you to swim faster during the effect.

- At master skill your basic shield magic effects will protect your weapons and armor from damage based on the strength of the shield. At 100% effect your weapons and armor will take no damage.

- Fire, Frost, Shock, and Poison Shield effects no longer provide physical armor bonus, instead they will damage attackers in melee range when struck, as well as provide elemental resistance. They will also add 25% of their effect as unarmed damage.

- Potions will now restore over time. The total number of potions you can consume at once is determined by the following formula - (Endurance + Alchemy)/25

- It is now possible to summon more than one minion at a time, once obtaining Master level Conjuration.

- Elemental spells now have a chance to cause extra effects, inspired by Skyrim. Fire spells can cause a very small additional burning damage. Frost spells cause a small additional fatigue drain. Shock spells cause a small additional magicka drain. At Destruction skill of 50 and 75, elemental magic effects will unlock impact effects. Chance to inflict them scales with Destruction skill and target’s resistance to particular element. At Journeyman level all effects have a chance to cause recoil; at Expert level Fire spells can knock back, Frost sometimes freezes the target in place, and Shock may inflict a short paralysis.

- Chameleon is capped at 75%. Resist Magic and Reflect Damage are capped at 85%

- Spell Absorption now behaves differently – instead of being chance-based, it always works and absorbs the percentage of incoming spell’s Magicka, but doesn’t protect from the spell itself
